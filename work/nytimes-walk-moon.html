                    <p>HOUSTON, Monday, July 21 - Men have landed and walked on the moon.</p>
                    <p>Two Americans, astronauts of Apollo 11, steered their fragile four-legged lunar module safely and smoothly to the historic landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern daylight time.</p>
                    <p>Neil A. Armstrong, the 38-year old civilian commander, radioed to earth and the mission control room here:</p>
                    <p>"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."</p>
                    <p>The first men to reach the moon - Mr. Armstrong and his co-pilot, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. of the Air Force - brought their ship to rest on a level, rock-strewn plain near the southwestern shore of the arid Sea of Tranquility.</p>
                    <p>About six and a half hours later, Mr. Armstrong opened the landing craft's hatch, stepped slowly down the ladder and declared as he planted the first human footprint on the lunar crust:</p>
                    <p>"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</p>
                    <p>His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., as a television camera outside the craft transmitted his every move to an awed and excited audience of hundreds of millions of people on earth.</p>
