**Updated Jan 11, 2020**

Follow this tutorial to **make a static website** with Python and Github Pages. It uses the Pelican static website generator. Hosted with Github pages using Cloudflare DNS and CDN.

I followed this procedure to setup the blog using Python and Pelican.
https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/

## Create accounts

Make sure you have accounts at Github and Cloudflare.

## Creating repos on Github

You need to create 2 repos for your source files and your output files. The source files can be written in `Markdown`. Then you use a command to convert these source files into output `HTML` files.

For source files:

    youruser.github.io-src

For output files:

    youruser.github.io

## Setup virtualenv

    pip install virtualenv

Test your installation with:

    virtualenv --version

Create a directory such as:

    mkdir blog

    cd blog

Create the environment with:

    virtualenv env

Activate it with:

    source env/bin/activate

The prompt will change to:

    env $

Follow the steps to install packages. If you want to leave the environment deactivate it with:

    deactivate

## Install Pelican

Inside the environment, install Pelican:

    env $ pip install pelican
    env $ pip install Markdown
    env $ pip install typogrify

Setup the source repo

    env $ git clone https://github.com/youruser/youruser.github.io-src.git ghpages

    env $ cd ghpages

Setup the output repo

    env $ git submodule add https://github.com/youruser/youruser.github.io.git output

Run the Pelican setup:

    env $ pelican-quickstart

## Caching your Github user and password

Later on when we are ready to publish to Github. When you `git push`. It will ask for your Github user and password.

Everytime that you push it will ask for your credentials. Which can be annoying if you want to push a few times within a short period.

You can cache your Github credentials using the following setup.

Inside the Pelican root directory make sure you are on the right repo:

    env $ git remote -v

This should give you the `.io-src.git` repo.

    env $ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

This will cache your credentials for 1 hour.

Now do the same for the output repo.

    env $ cd output

    env $ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

    env $ cd ..

## Pelican Setup

Answer the questions like this:

* Where to create the new site: Click Enter
* URL: `https://youruser.github.io`
* Generate Makefile: Yes
* Autoreload & simpleHTTP: Yes
* Upload mechanism: Select No for all except for Github, select Yes.
* Is this your personal page: Yes

According to this tutorial:

    https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/

If you get an error saying that the output directory already exists, that this is fine.

## Development and Production

There are config files.

The development config file is called `pelicanconf.py`.

The production config file is called `publishconf.py`.

## Update publishconf.py file

Open the file `publishconf.py` using your favorite editor, such as `vim`.

    env $ vim publishconf.py

Add or edit this line so it's set to `False`

	DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = False

## Update pelicanconf.py file:

Open the file `pelicanconf.py`.

    env $ vim pelicanconf.py

The default file usually looks like this:

	# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- #
	from __future__ import unicode_literals

	AUTHOR = u'Your Name'
	SITENAME = u'Your Site Title'
	SITEURL = ''

	PATH = 'content'

	TIMEZONE = 'America/New_York'

	DEFAULT_LANG = u'en'

	# Feed generation is usually not desired when developing
	FEED_ALL_ATOM = None
	CATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = None
	TRANSLATION_FEED_ATOM = None
	AUTHOR_FEED_ATOM = None
	AUTHOR_FEED_RSS = None

	# Blogroll
	LINKS = (('Pelican', 'http://getpelican.com/'),
	         ('Python.org', 'http://python.org/'),
	         ('Jinja2', 'http://jinja.pocoo.org/'),
	         ('You can modify those links in your config file', '#'),)

	# Social widget
	SOCIAL = (('You can add links in your config file', '#'),
	          ('Another social link', '#'),)

	# Uncomment following line if you want document-relative URLs when developing
	#RELATIVE_URLS = True

## Create structure of the blog

By default Pelican is setup as a blog, where the home page shows a list of blog posts with their summary.

To setup content of type `Pages`. Create a directory inside `content` such as:

    env $ mkdir content/pages

To setup images that you can use for `Posts` or `Pages`. Create a directory inside `content` such as:

    env $ mkdir content/images

If you will use a custom domain. Create another directory like this:

    env $ mkdir content/extra

To setup pagination. Edit `pelicanconf.py` and add this line:

    DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 5

To create the path to `images` and to `CNAME` add these lines to `pelicanconf.py`:

    STATIC_PATHS = ['images', 'extra/CNAME']
    EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {'extra/CNAME': {'path': 'CNAME'},}

## Create a CNAME file

If you have a custom domain, you need to create a CNAME file

    env $ vim content/extra/CNAME

Add your domain such as:

    www.yourdomain.com

## Create a blog post

To create a workflow from draft to published you need to edit `pelicanconf.py`:

    DEFAULT_METADATA = { 'status': 'draft', }

Create the blog posts inside `content` using markdown such as:

    env $ vim content/awesome-blog-post.md

Then use this format:

    Title: Awesome Blog Post Title
    Date: 2017-01-01 15:00
    Category: Awesome category
    Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
    Slug: awesome-blog-post
    Author: Homer Simpson
    Status: draft
    Summary: Summary of this awesome blog post. This will be the SEO description

    Start your awesome blog post here. Blabla
    blabla
    etc...

## Build the html and run the server

Save the blog post and run this:

    env $ make html && make serve

Open the browser in `localhost:8000`.

Since you set the status of the blog post to `draft`. You won't see it on the home page. You would have to open it at the slug location such as:

    localhost:8000/awesome-blog-post

To stop the server use `Ctrl+C`.

The draft to published workflow works well if you want others to review your content without having these posts appear on the home page. Otherwise just set the `Status` to `published`.

## Create a blog post from a template

It's pretty hard to remember the header for each blog post. I created a markdown template called `new_post_template.md` in my working directory and added this to `.gitignore`. Then I create a new blog post by copying this template such as:

    $ cp new_post_template.md content/name_of_new_blogpost.md

The template has this content:

    Title: Add Title
    Date: 2019-04-18 20:00
    Category: Linux
    Tags: tag1, tag2
    Slug: title-seo-with-dashes
    Author: Tom Ordonez
    Status: published
    Summary: Short SEO summary.

    Add content here.

## Create a page

You can create static pages such as the typical `about` page.

This type of content has to go inside the `content/pages` directory.

    env $ vim content/pages/about.md

Then follow a similar markdown format and status.

    Title: About
    Author: Your name
    Status: published
    Summary: awesome summary

    Start writing your awesome page here.

## Markdown crash course

Use this notation for hyperlinks:

    [square bracket for text](parenthesis for URL)

If you want to open the hyperlink in a new tab/window. This cannot be done with markdown. Instead you have the follow the html format:

    <a href="awesome-url" target="_blank">Awesome text</a>

Use this notation to add images:

    ![exclamation point and bracket for text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-file.jpg)

On the notation above you literally have to put `{static}`. Then the location of the image, which can be `jpg` or `png`.

Formatting code, use:

    4 leading spaces or `backticks` for inline.

For headlines use `#` hashtags. For an `h2` headline use `##` 2 hashtags.

For bullet points use `*` stars for `ul` or numbers for `ol`.

## Adding a theme

To see the location of default themes:

    pelican-themes -lv

This might change depending on your setup but in my case I got this:

    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pelican/themes/notmyidea
    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pelican/themes/simple

To get more themes go to this <a href="http://pelicanthemes.com/" target="_blank">Pelican themes</a> site.

Go to the repo for the one you like.

Git clone the repo. For example:

    env $ (cd ~/Downloads/ && git clone https://awesome-repo)

Let's say that the theme is called `homer`. The location will be `~/Downloads/homer/`.

Install the theme using this:

    env $  pelican-themes --install ~/Downloads/homer/ --verbose

What this will do is just copy the whole directory into your virtualenv:

    ~/.../env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pelican/themes/homer

Now you have to add something to the `pelicanconf.py` config file:

    THEME = 'homer'

Depending on the theme there might be a requirement to specify the css file. In which case you would need to add something like this:

    COLOR_SCHEME_CSS = 'awesome.css'

## Troubleshooting: gitmodules, multiple configurations found

You might get this error when pushing after making theme changes:

    gitmodules, multiple configurations found for 'submodule.themes/name-of-theme.path'. Skipping second one!

Open your `.gitmodules` file. In my case it looked like this:

    [submodule "themes/medius"]
    path = themes/medius
    url = https://github.com/onur/medius.git

    [submodule "themes/pelican-alchemy"]
    path = themes/pelican-alchemy
    url = https://github.com/nairobilug/pelican-alchemy

My current theme is `pelican-alchemy`. I removed the first three lines with the other theme references.

## Deploy to Github

Edit your `.gitignore` file and add this line:

    *.pyc

Use this to generate the site:

    env $ make publish

This will generate the site using the production settings. Which is the `publishconf.py` file.

This will also run the development config file because this file has this line:

    from pelicanconf import *

Deploying to Github requires to `git push` both repos. The source and the output.

Deploy the output.

    env $ cd output

    env $ git add .

    env $ git commit -m "Describe your commit here"

    env $ git push -u origin master

This will ask for your Github credentials. They will be cached for 1 hour.

Now deploy the source.

    env $ cd ..

    env $ git add .

    env $ git commit -m "Describe your commit here"

    env $ git push -u origin master

Browse to you blog:

    https://youruser.github.io

## Custom Domain

This requires to make some changes to Github, your DNS provider and Cloudflare

Change the DNS settings where you have your website registered.

Create these records:

    Type    Name               Content
    ALIAS   yoursite.com       youruser.github.io
    CNAME   www.yoursite.com   youruser.github.io
    TXT     yoursite.com       youruser.github.io

Change your DNS name server to the Cloudflare ones:

    aria.ns.cloudflare.com
    jay.ns.cloudflare.com

## Change the Github settings

Go to your output repo `github.io`.

Go to `Settings`.

Under `Custom domain` enter: www.yoursite.com

Save.

## Change the Cloudflare settings

Add A records as seen here:

https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/

Verify with Google webmaster tools.

* Add property
* Add TXT google verification code


Thanks to <a href="https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2017/01/13/using-https-with-custom-domain-name-on-github-pages.html" target="_blank">this awesome post</a>. This is how you setup Cloudflare.

Setup these Page rules.

    https://www.yoursite.com/*
    Cache Level: Cache Everything

    https://yoursite.com/*
    Forwarding URL: (Status Code: 301 - Permanent Redirect, URl: https://www.yoursite.com$1)

    http://www.yoursite.com/*
    Always Use HTTPS

In your Overview dashboard make sure you have these settings (if you are on the free plan)

* Security level: medium
* SSL: Full
* Caching level: Standard

## Change the Pelican production config file

Inside `publishconf.py` change this setting from:

    SITEURL = 'https://youruser.github.io'

to:

    SITEURL = 'https://www.yoursite.com'

## Push Custom domain changes to Github

Deploy the output.

    env $ make html && make publish

    env $ cd output

    env $ git add .

    env $ git commit -m "Custom domain update"

    env $ git push -u origin master

This might ask for your Github credentials. Unless they were cached.

Now deploy the source.

    env $ cd ..

    env $ git add .

    env $ git commit -m "Custom domain update"

    env $ git push -u origin master

## Setup SEO: robots.txt, favicon.ico, sitemap.xml

Modify your `pelicanconf.py` file so it looks like this:

	STATIC_PATHS = [
	        'images',
	        'extra/CNAME',
	        'extra/robots.txt',
	        'extra/favicon.ico',
	        ]

	EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
	        'extra/CNAME': {'path': 'CNAME'},
	        'extra/robots.txt': {'path': 'robots.txt'},
	        'extra/favicon.ico': {'path': 'favicon.ico'},
	        }

	### Plugins

	PLUGIN_PATHS = [
	        'pelican-plugins'
	          ]

	PLUGINS = [
	          'sitemap', 
	          ]

	# Sitemap
	SITEMAP = {
	            'format': 'xml',
	            'priorities': {
	                'articles': 0.5,
	                'indexes': 0.5,
	                'pages': 0.5
	            },
	            'changefreqs': {
	                'articles': 'weekly',
	                'indexes': 'daily',
	                'pages': 'monthly'
	            }
	}

## Create the robots.txt

Go to your Pelican root directory and create the `robots.txt` file:

    env $ vim content/extra/robots.txt

Add this line to the file:

    User-agent: *


## Create the favicon.ico

Go to the directory `content/extra/` and add a `favicon.ico` image.

Create a directory for the plugins in the Pelican root directory:

    env $ mkdir pelican-plugins


## Create the sitemap

Create a directory for the sitemap plugin:

    env $ mkdir pelican-plugins/sitemap

As seen on the <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/sitemap" target="_blank">Sitemap page</a>. Copy the 3 files from this repo into the `pelican-plugins/sitemap` directory.

The directory should contain these files:

    Readme.rst
    __init__.py
    sitemap.py

Generate the site:

    env $ make publish

Verify that the `sitemap.xml` was generated inside the `output` directory.

## Git Push SEO changes to Github

Deploy the output.

    env $ cd output

    env $ git add .

    env $ git commit -m "sitemap, robots, favicon"

    env $ git push -u origin master

This might ask for your Github credentials. Unless they were cached.

Now deploy the source.

    env $ cd ..

    env $ git add .

    env $ git commit -m "sitemap, robots, favicon"

    env $ git push -u origin master

## Troubleshooting: using `{filename}` instead of `{static}`

I recently had issues with my blog when publishing posts. After calling `make html && make publish`. I started getting errors that I was using `{filename}` instead of `{static}`. My mistake. I had the incorrect syntax or perhaps just outdated in multiple posts, when linking to static images inside the `content/images` directory.

    WARNING: {filename} used for linking to staticcontent

Following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11392478/how-to-replace-a-string-in-multiple-files-in-linux-command-line/29191549" target="_blank">this solution</a> to replace a word on multiple files, I ran this:

    $ cd path/to/content folder
    $ sed -i 's/filename/static/g' *.md

Like magic, it updated all the files with the correct syntax. I also had to run the same command inside `content/pages` for all `.md` files.

## Fork and sync a local with a remote repo

As seen on my [learning Github](https://www.tomordonez.com/learning-github.html) blog post. I have a setup to create blog posts on one machine and deploy the changes from a local server. I do this to experiment and learn with a sort of Git/Github lab.

The local server has installed the static web server in production, following all the steps as mentioned before. It's linked to a sort of master Github account:

`Master repo: https://github.com/original_owner/original_repo.git`

The development machine has a forked repo from the master repo and it uses a different Github account.

`Forked repo: https://github.com/your_username/your_fork.git`

Configure a remote for a fork as seen [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)

Review the remotes you have:

    $ git remove -v
    > origin  https://github.com/your_username/your_fork.git (fetch)
    > origin  https://github.com/your_username/your_fork.git (push)

Create a remote upstream repo with the original

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/original_owner/original_repo.git

Check that the new remote was created

    $ git remote -v

Sync your fork with the original upstream as seen [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)

    $ git fetch upstream

It creates a new branch that stores `master` into `upstream/master`:

    >  * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master

Checkout the local `master` branch:

    $ git checkout master

Merge the changes from `upstream/master` into local `master`:

    $ git merge upstream/master

## Troubleshooting: Merging is not possible because you have unmerged files

When running:

    $ git merge upstream/master

You might get this error:

    error: Merging is not possible because you have unmerged files.                                                                                                              
    hint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'                                                                                                         
    hint: as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.                                                                                                                   
    fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.

Check:

    $ git status

I had these:

    Unmerged paths:
      (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
            both modified:   .gitignore

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            .gitmodules_bk
            new_post_template.md

I added these files and committed the changes from the `git fetch upstream`

    $ git add .
    $ git commit "merged upstream/master"
