I recently moved from Wordpress to Pelican Python. Pelican is a static generator based on Python.

Through the years I have used many platforms.

I started in blogger. Then drupal. Then wordpress. Then tumblr. Then squarespace. Then Octopress with Github pages. Back to Wordpress. Then Medium. Back to Wordpress again.

I have been studying a lot of data science for the last few months and I am focused on Python now.

I initially thought of rebuilding my website from scratch using Python and Django, which could be a fun pet project. But I delayed learning Django.

Instead I decided on a static generator based on Python. I asked suggestions from my Linkedin network and a few people suggested Pelican.

This is Pelican on Github pages.
