A short description of my vimrc config file.

Edit with:

    vim ~/.vimrc

I want to see the line number always:

    set number

Show the line number, the column number, and the relative position of the cursor in the file, as a percentage. More details <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2010/11/28/vim-ruler-and-default-ruler-format/" target="_blank">here</a>.

    set ruler

Show the current static always.

    set laststatus=2

I like writing blog posts with lines wrapped at 80 characters without creating a new line.

    set wrap
    set columns=80
    set linebreak

I also have a few Plugins. Read this [tutorial to install a plugin in Vim](https://www.tomordonez.com/install-plugin-vim.html).

* Markdown with correct code highlight
* A better JSON for Vim
* Color schemes

And my favorite: **Autosave in Vim**.
