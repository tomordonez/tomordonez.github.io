This is a tutorial on web scraping with Python. Learn to scrape websites with Python and BeautifulSoup.

![Scraping one page log file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/scraping_one_page_log_file.gif)

1. Setup web scraping with Python.
2. Web scraping target and expected result.
3. Setup logging in Python.
4. Setup BeautifulSoup and export to CSV.
5. Scrape one page.
6. Scrape multiple pages.

## To scrape or not to scrape

There are a lot of tools with a user interface that allows you to point to content on a page and it scrapes everything for you.

There is also the question of scraping or not. Can you easily copy/paste the content and modify it with Excel? Or with a text editor like Sublime Text?

While some tools can scrape things for you. Sometimes it's hard to customize them or they don't have some features you want and you have to pay for them.

This tutorial assumes that you want the freedom to scrape anything you want and customize the tool however you think is best for your needs.

## 1. Setup web scraping with Python.

For this tutorial on web scraping I am using Python3. There are a lot of tutorials online on how to install Python3.

If you are new to Python. This tutorial might not be the best first step for you. Here are some good resources:

* [Official Python Docs](https://www.python.org/)
* [Coursera Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

I am also using a virtual environment. Here is a great blog post on Python virtual environments.

* [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)
* [Python docs on virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/)

If you are not familiar with Unix commands. Here are some resources:

* Strongly recommend a book called "Unix for the Beginning Mage". You can download it online.
* You can practice using this interactive shell on the browser: `https://www.learnshell.org/`.

I am using Linux Fedora. The output of the commands you see in this tutorial might be different than yours.

Once you have `Python3` and `virtualenv` installed then you can setup a virtual environment like this:

* Create a project directory: `mkdir scraping`
* Go there: `cd scraping`.
* Where is Python3? `which python3`.
* Output is: `/usr/bin/python3`.
* Setup virtualenv: `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 env`
* Activate: `source env/bin/activate`.

Activating a virtual environment will add `(env)` to your terminal. To deactivate use `deactivate`.

## 2. Web scraping target and expected result.

If you made it to this point. It is downhill from here...that was a joke. It's not :)

Unless you have some experience in Python. Then this should be easy.

What do you want to scrape? A page or multiple pages? What output do you want?

For this tutorial we are going to scrape speakers from a conference and the output is a CSV file with data about these speakers.

I see that CES is coming up. Found the list of speakers on this page:

`https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx`.

Scrolled all the way down. Looks like a lot of speakers.

![CES Speakers]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ces_speakers.gif)

Let's open the first speaker in another tab to see what content is there:

* Name of speaker
* Title
* Company
* Bio

## Scraping metadata

What is else is there besides what we can read on the page?

Right click, Inspect.

It has `meta name="keywords"`. Do we need these? Maybe.

![CES Speaker Meta Keywords]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ces_speakers_meta_keywords.jpg)

It has a `meta name="description"` with a shorter bio.

## Scraping web content

The name of the speaker is under this tag:

    <h1 class="global-hero__title">

I see a problem. The `title` and `company` are on the same sentence, separated by a comma and it is under this tag:

    <h2 class="alt">Head of Studio, SoftBank Robotics</h2>

There is no separate tag between `title` name and `company` name.

On the other hand, the speakers list has `title` name and `company` name on different tags.

    <h4 class="speaker-title">Head of Studio</h4>
    <h4 class="speaker-company">SoftBank Robotics</h4>

Can I extract this content by just copy/pasting? It doesn't seem so. The result is:

    name
    title
    company
    name
    title
    company

There is no way of knowing how to break this into a `CSV` file but we could take the risk of following the pattern of creating a speaker row for every 3 lines. Although I don't see how to do this without writing some code.

We could also scrape the Speakers page but it doesn't have the bios. It just has:

* name
* title
* company

## To bio or not to bio

Here is the dilemma.

On the speakers page we have:

* name
* title
* company
* speaker conference url
* no bio
* Title and company are on different html tags.

On each speaker page we have:

* name
* title
* company
* bio
* Title and company are on the same html tag, separated by a comma.

Can we scrape the title and company from the same html tag? Then do some magic (regex) to separate the data?

This seems risky.

What if the title already has a comma?

Such as:

* Name: Homer Simpson
* Title: Nuclear Engineer, Research
* Company: ACME, Inc

And the html tag has this: `<h2 class="alt">Nuclear Engineer, Research, ACME, Inc</h2>`.

This would be impossible to extract if speakers have different variations of where the comma is placed to separate title and company.

If we only scrape the speakers page then we will miss the `bio`.

We will look at both cases and make some decisions later.

## 3. Setup logging in Python.

Here is a [Python logging tutorial](https://www.tomordonez.com/python-logging-tutorial.html) to get all the details.

We want to capture a log file when running the script. That way we can see what worked and what didn't. You could use `print` statements but it will be hard to read the terminal output after running the script a few times.

For this blog post we just have to add this code towards the top:

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    fh = logging.FileHandler('output.log')
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)

Then `logger` can be used as in the following examples.

Example 1:

    for url in urls:
        logger.info('Reading URL: %s', url)

Example 2:

    page_title = soup.find('title').text
    logger.info('page title captured: %s', page_title)

Then we have to close the log file at the end of the script:

    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

## 4. Setup BeautifulSoup and export to CSV.

For both files we need to add this code:

    import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    import csv

Why use `urllib` and not `requests`? It works and I always used it. But you are free to use any other library.

Followed by the logging setup

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    fh = logging.FileHandler('output.log')
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)

Followed by closing the logging file:

    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

In between the logging setup we need to add our code.

## Setup BeautifulSoup

Given a url:

    url = 'https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx'
    read_url = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    soup = bs(read_url, 'html.parser')

Read more about `BeautifulSoup` here:

* [Python Lambda and BeautifulSoup](https://www.tomordonez.com/python-lambda.html)

## Export data to a CSV file

The usual is to export the scraped data to a CSV file.

    with open('leads.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(['column1', 'column2', 'column3'])

Then after saving data into variables. Use `writerow` to save the data to the CSV file.

## 5. Scrape one page

So far we have this:

    import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    import csv
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    fh = logging.FileHandler('output.log')
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)

    with open('leads.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(['column1', 'column2', 'column3'])

    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

Let's create two scripts and save this code to each:

* `one_page.py`
* `many_pages.py`

## Scrape the page that has the list of speakers:

* Name
* Title
* Company
* Speaker conference url
* No bio

The URL is: `https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx`.

Adding to the template code above. Modify the name of the log file. From `output.log` to `one_page_output.log`.

Add the `url` and create a `BeautifulSoup` object.

    url = 'https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx'
    read_url = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    soup = bs(read_url, 'html.parser')

Then create the `CSV` file:

    with open('one_page_leads.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(['name', 'title', 'company', 'url'])

Instead of running the script multiple times to try to scrape the data. I like to work on the Python shell to see the results and then add the code to the script.

## Test scraping using the shell:

    (env)$ python
    >>>

Then setup the script with `BeautifulSoup`:

    >>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    >>> import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    >>> url = 'https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx'
    >>> urlopen =  urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    >>> soup = bs(urlopen, 'html.parser')

Now we need to Inspect the `HTML` on the page and use `soup` methods to extract the data.

![One-page scrape speaker data]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/one_page_scrape_speaker_data.jpg)

To view `soup` methods you can try:

    >>> dir(soup)

It will show a list of all methods.

Get some help about a method using `help`:

    >>> help(soup.find)

It shows the following syntax:

    find(name=None, attrs={}, recursive=True, text=None, **kwargs)

Each speaker has an `HTML` that looks like this:

    <aside class="speaker-photo directory small">
        <a href="/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed">
            <picture class="head-shot" style="background-image: url('https://hubb.blob.core.windows.net/e955a157-fba9-4f75-9465-67396ae15f0e-profile/546100')"></picture>
        </a>
        
            <a href="/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed">
                <h3 class="speaker-name">Omar Abdelwahed </h3>
            </a>
            <h4 class="speaker-title">Head of Studio</h4>
            <h4 class="speaker-company">SoftBank Robotics</h4>
        
    </aside>

The parent tag is:

    <aside class="speaker-photo directory small">

The child tags have this content:

* `<h3 class="speaker-name">`
* `<h4 class="speaker-title">`
* `<h4 class="speaker-company">`
* `<a href="/conference/speaker-directory/...`

Which correspond to `name`, `title`, `company` and `url`.

## Scrape one name

    >>> soup.find('h3', attrs={'class': 'speaker-name'})

The output is:

    <h3 class="speaker-name">Omar Abdelwahed </h3>

This is correct but we only want the text inside the tag.

    >>> soup.find('h3', attrs={'class': 'speaker-name'}).text
    'Omar Abdelwahed '

But this only finds one name.

## Scrape all the names

This doesn't work:

    >>> soup.find_all('h3', attrs={'class': 'speaker-name'}).text

It has this error:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    AttributeError: ResultSet object has no attribute 'text'.
    You're probably treating a list of items like a single item.
    Did you call find_all() when you meant to call find()?

Then try this:

    >>> soup.find_all('h3', attrs={'class': 'speaker-name'})

The output is a list of `soup` objects with the `<h3 class="speaker-name">` tag and text.

## Scraping and matching rows

I thought of this. We can scrape the list of names. But what about the other data that corresponds to each speaker.

The names could be:

    names = [name1, name2, name3, ...]

Then titles:

    titles = [title1, title2, title3,...]

But how do we join these two lists? What if the data doesn't match?

We need to find the correct data structure to put all the scraped data.

## Scraping the parent tag

The parent tag that has the data for each speaker is:

    <aside class="speaker-photo directory small">

We can use this code to find the first speaker:

    >>> soup.find('aside', attrs={'class': 'speaker-photo directory small'})
    
    <aside class="speaker-photo directory small">
    <a href="/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed">
    <picture class="head-shot" style="background-image: url('https://hubb.blob.core.windows.net/e955a157-fba9-4f75-9465-67396ae15f0e-profile/546100')"></picture>
    </a>
    <caption class="speaker-info">
    <a href="/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed">
    <h3 class="speaker-name">Omar Abdelwahed </h3>
    </a>
    <h4 class="speaker-title">Head of Studio</h4>
    <h4 class="speaker-company">SoftBank Robotics</h4>
    </caption>
    </aside>

Use this code to put the `HTML` content for all speakers into a list:

    >>> soup.find_all('aside', attrs={'class': 'speaker-photo directory small'})

Assign to a variable:

    >>> speakers = soup.find_all('aside', attrs={'class': 'speaker-photo directory small'})

Use this: `speakers[0]` to see the content of the first speaker.

    <aside class="speaker-photo directory small">
    <a href="/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed">
    <picture class="head-shot" style="background-image: url('https://hubb.blob.core.windows.net/e955a157-fba9-4f75-9465-67396ae15f0e-profile/546100')"></picture>
    </a>
    <caption class="speaker-info">
    <a href="/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed">
    <h3 class="speaker-name">Omar Abdelwahed </h3>
    </a>
    <h4 class="speaker-title">Head of Studio</h4>
    <h4 class="speaker-company">SoftBank Robotics</h4>
    </caption>
    </aside>

Now we can get separate the data for each speaker...

Actually I am not sure what methods I can use. Let's use help:

    >>> help(speakers[0])

    Help on Tag in module bs4.element object:

    class Tag(PageElement)
    |  Represents a found HTML tag with its attributes and contents.
    |  
    |  Method resolution order:
    |      Tag
    |      PageElement
    |      builtins.object
    |  
    |  Methods defined here:

This documentation is long. Here is an extract:

    |  
    |  find(self, name=None, attrs={}, recursive=True, text=None, **kwargs)
    |      Return only the first child of this Tag matching the given
    |      criteria.
    |  
    |  findAll = find_all(self, name=None, attrs={}, recursive=True, text=None, limit=None, **kwargs)
    |  
    |  findChild = find(self, name=None, attrs={}, recursive=True, text=None, **kwargs)
    |  findChildren = find_all(self, name=None, attrs={}, recursive=True, text=None, limit=None, **kwargs)
    |  
    |  find_all(self, name=None, attrs={}, recursive=True, text=None, limit=None, **kwargs)
    |      Extracts a list of Tag objects that match the given
    |      criteria.  You can specify the name of the Tag and any
    |      attributes you want the Tag to have.
    |      
    |      The value of a key-value pair in the 'attrs' map can be a
    |      string, a list of strings, a regular expression object, or a
    |      callable that takes a string and returns whether or not the
    |      string matches for some custom definition of 'matches'. The
    |      same is true of the tag name.
    |  
    |  get(self, key, default=None)
    |      Returns the value of the 'key' attribute for the tag, or
    |      the value given for 'default' if it doesn't have that
    |      attribute.
    |  
    |  getText = get_text(self, separator='', strip=False, types=(<class 'bs4.element.NavigableString'>, <class 'bs4.element.CData'>))
    |  
    |  get_attribute_list(self, key, default=None)
    |      The same as get(), but always returns a list.
    |  get_text(self, separator='', strip=False, types=(<class 'bs4.element.NavigableString'>, <class 'bs4.element.CData'>))
    |      Get all child strings, concatenated using the given separator.
    |  

## Scrape the URL

Here is the code to capture the URL bio from `speakers[0]`:

    >>> speakers[0].find('a').get('href')
    '/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed'

## Scrape the name

This is the HTML that contains the name:

    <h3 class="speaker-name">Omar Abdelwahed </h3>

Use this code to scrape the name:

    >>> speakers[0].find('h3', attrs={'class': 'speaker-name'}).text
    'Omar Abdelwahed '

I see it has whitespace at the end of the string. But not sure if this is just this one or all of them. Not a big deal for now.

## Scrape the title

This HTML has the title:

    <h4 class="speaker-title">Head of Studio</h4>

Use this code:

    >>> speakers[0].find('h4', attrs={'class': 'speaker-title'}).text
    'Head of Studio'

## Scrape the company

This HTML has the company:

    <h4 class="speaker-company">SoftBank Robotics</h4>

Use the code:

    >>> speakers[0].find('h4', attrs={'class': 'speaker-company'}).text
    'SoftBank Robotics'

## Add this code to the script `one_page.py`

We don't need to use `speakers[0]` anymore. We are going to find all speakers into a list. Then use a loop to scrape the data from each speaker. Then write the row to `CSV`.

We are going to use exceptions in case a data value from a speaker is not found.

And we will add logging for each step.

    import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    import csv
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    fh = logging.FileHandler('one_page_output.log')
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)


    url = 'https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx'
    read_url = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    soup = bs(read_url, 'html.parser')

    with open('one_page_leads.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(['name', 'title', 'company', 'url'])

        speakers = soup.find_all('aside', attrs={'class': 'speaker-photo directory small'})
        for speaker in speakers:

            logger.info('Scraping a speaker...')
            print('Scraping a speaker...')

            try:
                url = speaker.find('a').get('href')
            except:
                logger.info('No URL found')
                url = 'Not found'

            try:
                name = speaker.find('h3', attrs={'class': 'speaker-name'}).text
            except:
                logger.info('Name not found')
                name = 'Not found'

            try:
                title = speaker.find('h4', attrs={'class': 'speaker-title'}).text
            except:
                logger.info('Title not found')
                title = 'Not found'

            try:
                company = speaker.find('h4', attrs={'class': 'speaker-company'}).text
            except:
                logger.info('Company not found')
                company = 'Not found'

            logger.info('Saving %s to CSV', name)
            csvwriter.writerow([name, title, company, url])

    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

## Running the script `one_page.py`

Run the script with:

    $ python one_page.py

It will take a few seconds to capture the page and then it will print to the terminal:

    Scraping a speaker...
    Scraping a speaker...
    Scraping a speaker...
    Scraping a speaker...
    Scraping a speaker...
    ...

## Review the log file

We saved the log file with this name: `one_page_output.log`

![Scraping one page log file]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/scraping_one_page_log_file.gif)

It looks like it scraped all the data.

## Review the CSV file

We named the CSV file: `one_page_leads.csv`.

![Scraped data into CSV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/scraping_one_page_data.gif)

It looks good. But the dilemma continues. We don't have the `bios`.

## 6. Scrape multiple pages.

We can add more to the script if we really want the `bio` for each speaker.

Let's just copy the script over to a new file: `many_pages.py`.

But first let's test how to get a `bio` using the Python shell.

The first URL from the CSV file is this:

    /conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed

Go to the shell:

    >>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    >>> import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    >>> url = 'https://www.ces.tech/conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed'
    >>> urlopen =  urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    >>> soup = bs(urlopen, 'html.parser')

Previously we saw that there were 2 bios.

## Short bio

This metadata has a short bio:

    <meta name="description" content="Omar Abdelwahed is Head of Studio at SoftBank Robotics America where he is responsible for leading the development of robotics applications in America, and the overall user experience, globally">

Scrape it with:

    >>> soup.find('meta', attrs={'name': 'description'}).get('content')

    'Omar Abdelwahed is Head of Studio at SoftBank Robotics America where he is responsible for leading the development of robotics applications in America, and the overall user experience, globally'

## Long bio

This tag has a long bio:

    <article class="speaker-bio">
    <p>Omar Abdelwahed is Head of Studio at SoftBank Robotics America where he is responsible for leading the development of robotics applications in America, and the overall user experience, globally. Previously, Omar was VP of Engineering at Mighty Play, a game developer in San Francisco. Omar has over 20 years of experience as an engineer with a deep background in entertainment and technology. Omar’s career has spanned large video game publishers, retailers, startups, and his own independent work. Omar is the founder of Agent Disco, an independent mobile games developer. He is a frequent conference speaker on technology topics, including AI, robotics, data privacy, and product development.</p>
    <div>
    </div>
    </article>

Scrape it with:

    >>> soup.find('article', attrs={'class': 'speaker-bio'}).find('p').text

    'Omar Abdelwahed is Head of Studio at SoftBank Robotics America where he is responsible for leading the development of robotics applications in America, and the overall user experience, globally. Previously, Omar was VP of Engineering at Mighty Play, a game developer in San Francisco. Omar has over 20 years of experience as an engineer with a deep background in entertainment and technology. Omar’s career has spanned large video game publishers, retailers, startups, and his own independent work. Omar is the founder of Agent Disco, an independent mobile games developer. He is a frequent conference speaker on technology topics, including AI, robotics, data privacy, and product development.'

Looks like the short bio is the first sentence up to the first period. For others it might or might not be the same.

Maybe we should scrape both just in case.

I opened a few profiles and noticed some have additional data.

## Linkedin URL

Found that this profile:

    https://www.ces.tech/conference/speaker-directory/Charlie--Ackerman.aspx

Has a Linkedin URL:

    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-ackerman-56499013/" target="_blank" class="fab fa-linkedin"></a>

Scrape it with:

    >>> soup.find('a', attrs={'class': 'fab fa-linkedin'}).get('href')

    'https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-ackerman-56499013/'


## Modifying the script `many_pages.py`

Same setup as before but change log file name and csv file name:

    import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    import csv
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    fh = logging.FileHandler('many_pages_output.log')
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)

    url = 'https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx'
    read_url = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    soup = bs(read_url, 'html.parser')

    with open('many_pages_leads.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(['name', 'title', 'company', 'url'])

    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

We need to make some additional changes.

Once we capture each `URL` we need to scrape the data:

* short bio
* long bio
* Linkedin URL

Change the column names of the `CSV` file:

    with open('many_pages_leads.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(['name', 'title', 'company', 'url', 'short_bio', 'long_bio', 'linkedin'])

A scraped `URL` has this form:

    /conference/speaker-directory/Omar-Abdelwahed

To scrape this page we need the complete `URL`. Maybe add this variable:

    root_url = 'https://www.ces.tech'

## The final script is this

Ideally this could be broken into modules but for now this is the final script:

    import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    import csv
    import logging
    
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    fh = logging.FileHandler('many_pages_output.log')
    fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter(('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)
    
    root_url = 'https://www.ces.tech'
    
    url = 'https://www.ces.tech/Conference/Speaker-Directory.aspx'
    urlopen = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
    soup = bs(urlopen, 'html.parser')
    
    with open('many_pages_leads.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
        csvwriter.writerow(['name', 'title', 'company', 'url', 'short_bio', 'long_bio', 'linkedin'])
    
        speakers = soup.find_all('aside', attrs={'class': 'speaker-photo directory small'})
        for speaker in speakers:
    
            logger.info('Scraping a speaker...')
            print('Scraping a speaker...')
            
            try:
                name = speaker.find('h3', attrs={'class': 'speaker-name'}).text
            except:
                logger.info('Name not found')
                name = 'Not found'
    
            try:
                title = speaker.find('h4', attrs={'class': 'speaker-title'}).text
            except:
                logger.info('Title not found')
                title = 'Not found'
    
            try:
                company = speaker.find('h4', attrs={'class': 'speaker-company'}).text
            except:
                logger.info('Company not found')
                company = 'Not found'
            
            try:
                url = speaker.find('a').get('href')
    
                url_speaker = urllib.request.urlopen(root_url + url).read()
                soup_speaker = bs(url_speaker, 'html.parser')
    
                # Get short bio
                try:
                    short_bio = soup_speaker.find('meta', attrs={'name': 'description'}).get('content')
                except:
                    logger.info('Short bio not found')
                    short_bio = 'Not found'
    
                # Get long bio
                try:
                    long_bio = soup_speaker.find('article', attrs={'class': 'speaker-bio'}).find('p').text
                except:
                    logger.info('Long bio not found')
                    long_bio = 'Not found'
    
                # Get Linkedin
                try:
                    linkedin = soup_speaker.find('a', attrs={'class': 'fab fa-linkedin'}).get('href')
                except:
                    logger.info('Linkedin URL not found')
                    linkedin = 'Not found'
    
            except:
                logger.info('URL not found')
                url = 'Not found'
    
            logger.info('Saving %s to CSV', name)
    
            csvwriter.writerow([name, title, company, url, short_bio, long_bio, linkedin])
    
    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

## Reviewing results

You can open the log file in Sublime to see progress. Or just monitor the file size and you will see the log file increasing size.

Open the CSV file to see the output so far:

![CES Speakers]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/scraping_many_pages.gif)

## To module or not to module

This looks like a one-time script. A sort of scrape-on-demand. Scrape a specific page and move on. Another scrape project would have a different `HTML` structure depending on what you want to scrape.

You could use the same setup for `logging` and `CSV` but there is room for growth if you break this into modules:

* Ask for user input instead of hardcoding the URLs.
* Use a `main` function for the setup.
* Use modules for scraping.
* Use a random function to ease on the scraping.of hardcoding the URLs.
