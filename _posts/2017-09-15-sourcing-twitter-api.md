Follow this process for sourcing with the Twitter API. Getting data using Ruby and the Twitter API


Twitter CLI is a command line interface program that allows you to interact with your Twitter account using the command line.

## Objectives

* Source on Twitter with the Twitter API.
* Convert data into a clean list of users.
* Get user information.
* Find websites, emails, phone numbers.
* Find out what users talk about to create a better outreach.

Get massive amounts of data with a simple one-liner "formula".

## Why?

Perhaps you only source with Linkedin. Perhaps you know boolean searches.

A boolean search is like a baby learning to swim. Learning how to source on Twitter with the API is like being Michael Phelps.

Do you want to be Michael Phelps? Continue reading.

## Requirements

This won't be easy. If it were easy then anybody could do it.

This requires:

* A general understanding about how computers work.
* You need to have: A Twitter account and a Twitter developer app.
* You need to have a Windows with a Linux Virtual Machine or a Mac or a computer with Linux.
* Ruby installed and some basic Ruby knowledge.
* Knowledge of the command line.
* Bash scripting knowledge.
* A lot of confidence and attention to detail

## You need to have a Twitter account

If you don't have a Twitter account. Something must be wrong in the Universe.


## You need to have a Twitter developer app

Go to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new" target="_blank">Twitter Application Management</a>

Sign-in using your Twitter account.

Click on Create New App.

Fill out the form.

* Name of the app
* Description
* Website, including `http://`

Go to Permissions and set Access to "Read, Write and Access direct messages"

You might need to authorize your Twitter account with your mobile phone. Go to: <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/settings" target="_blank">Mobile Twitter settings</a>.

Towards the bottom it should have a "Phone" listed.

## If you are on Windows you need Linux in a Virtual Machine

Your computer should have at least 8GB of RAM for this.

A Virtual Machine (VM) is used to install an operating system inside another one. Therefore a "virtual machine".

In this case we need to install Linux inside Windows.

Install the VM from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a>.

Choose `Virtualbox for Windows`

Download and install the defaults.

Now download Linux Ubuntu from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank">here</a>.

This downloads a file of type `.iso`

DO NOT double click on this file to open it. We will only open this file with VirtualBox.

Open VirtualBox:

* Click on the button "New"
* Name: Ubuntu
* Memory size: 4096
* Choose: Create a virtual hard drive now
* Hard drive file type: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)
* Storage on physical hard drive: Dynamically allocated
* Select the size of the virtual hard drive: 10.00 GB

A new VM has been created with name "Ubuntu". With status "Powered Off".

Click on the arrow "Start".

Choose the Ubuntu "iso" file that you downloaded.

The VM will load with Ubuntu. Then follow the instructions to install the defaults.

## Do You have a Mac?

You are almost all set here.

Just need to install 2 programs:

The text editor Sublime. <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Download here</a>.

The terminal iTerm. <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank">Download here</a>.

## You need to have Knowledge of the command line.

In Windows there is a program called the "Command Prompt". (We are not going to use this)

In Mac or Linux there is a program called the "Terminal" aka "the shell" aka "the bash shell" aka "the command line"

This "command line" helps you communicate with the computer by using code.

A few basic "command line" examples are:

Open the terminal and type this code to see who is the current user logged in:

    $ whoami

You don't need to type in the `$` dollar sign. This is the Terminal "prompt" inviting you to talk to the computer. Whenever you see the dollar sign. It means this is a command line code.

Type this code to see a list of directories:

    $ ls

Type this code to change directories:

    $ cd Downloads

Type this code to copy the contents of one file to another:

    $ cp this_file to_this_file

There are a lot more "commands" that you can use to communicate with the computer. Later, I will explain a few more.

## You need to install Ruby

Ruby is a "high level programming language" that reads sort of like English.

Ruby has "modules" called "Gems" that add more functionality to a program.


## Ruby on Windows with Linux Virtual Machine

Open VirtualBox and start the Ubuntu virtual machine.

Open the terminal.

Follow this guideline to <a href="https://www.tomordonez.com/installing-ruby-on-ubuntu.html" target="_blank">Install Ruby on Ubuntu</a>.

## Ruby on Mac

If you have a Mac. The installation process is similar to Ubuntu.


## You need to Install Twitter CLI ruby gem

Twitter CLI aka `t` is a Ruby gem that helps you connect with the Twitter API using the command line. Say that out loud 3 times.

In the Terminal type:

    $ gem install t

Previously you created an app on Twitter. We need to authenticate this app with our (Twitter CLI) ruby gem.

    $ t authorize

This will say:

    Welcome!...
    1. Sign in to Twitter..."create a new app"
    2. Complete the required fields...
    3. Go to Permissions tab...
    4. Go to the Keys and Access Tokens tab...

    Press Enter to open the Twitter Developer site

When you hit enter then:

* Firefox opens Twitter Application Management
* The terminal says Enter API Key

Open the app that you created:

* Go to permissions tab
* Go to Keys and access tokens

Copy/paste those into the Terminal.

Then that opens a site that says "Authorize App".

Then it gives you a pin number that you have to enter in the Terminal.

If it works, it will say:

    Authorization successful



## Input and Output to send data

There is another important computer science concept that you need to learn.

Input and Output.

* When you type into Word. The input is the keyboard and the output is the Word document.
* When you want to print the document. The input is the Word document. The output is the printer

You can redirect data in different ways using simple code.

## Redirecting data with Add and Append

    > A greater than sign means "add".
    >> Two greater than signs mean "append".

When you use a command line such as `ls` to list the contents of your current directory. The output is sent to the "standard output" aka "stdout". Which is the Terminal screen.

Instead we could list the contents of a current directory and send the output to a file.

    $ ls > directory-contents.txt

In this example we are using `ls` to list the contents of the current directory. Then we are using `>` to "add" the output to the file `directory-contents.txt`.

## Redirecting data with Pipe

    | This symbol is called a "Pipe".

With pipes you can redirect the output of one side to the input of another side.

    $ ls | wc -l

In this example we are using `ls` again to ask the computer for the contents in the current directory.

    wc is another command called "word count" that helps you count words from a text file.

If you use it like this: `wc -l` it will count the number of lines from a text file.

We use the pipe `|` to send the output of `ls` (the contents of the current directory) to the command `wc -l` to count the number of lines.

## How to source on Twitter

Open the Terminal.

Get a list of all available commands:

    $ t help

## Send a tweet from the command line

    $ t update "I am tweeting from the command line"

## Get details about a Twitter user

    $ t whois tomordonez

## Create a List of People That Don't Follow You

First, count the number of people that you follow that donâ€™t follow you back:

    $ t leaders | wc -l

With `leaders` you can get a list of people that you follow but don't follow you.

With `|` you are redirecting the output to the command `wc -l` to count the number of lines.

If there is 1 user for each line. Then you will get the number of users. 

Now create a Twitter list:

    $ t list create NameoftheList

Add those people to the list. Keep in mind that it might get stuck up to 500 users. Just wait a few minutes and try it again.

    $ t leaders | xargs t list add NameoftheList

In this example we are using `t leaders` again to get a list of people that you follow but don't follow you back.

We are sending that output to `xargs`. Which reads the output line by line and executes the next command `t list add NameoftheList`, to add every user to that Twitter list.

## Download Users That Belong To A Twitter list

Let's get back to the Ruby developer example.

The most famous Ruby conference is called "Ruby Conf" and they often use the Twitter hashtag #RubyConf.

You can create a Twitter list and add people that use this hashtag.

Go to the Terminal and use this code to get a list of all your Twitter lists:

    $ t lists your-username

Replacing "your-username" with your Twitter username. With or without the `@`. It doesn't matter.

Find the Twitter list you created. Let's say that the Twitter list is called `rubyconf`.

    $ t lists tomordonez

This will display all my lists and it might be hard to find the one I am looking for.

    $ t lists tomordonez | grep 'ruby'

This code is using the pipe `|` to send the output of `t lists tomordonez` to the input of `grep 'ruby'`.

`grep` is another command that "filters" data. In this case is filtering the output of all my Twitter lists and find only those that contain the word `ruby`

It will find a list such as:

    @tomordonez/rubyconf

With the name of the Twitter list now we can download the list of all users that are members of this list.

    $ t list members -c @tomordonez/rubyconf > twitter-list-rubyconf-members.csv

This code is using the redirection `>` which sends the output of `t list members @tomordonez/rubyconf` to the input of `twitter-list-rubyconf-members.txt`.

This code is pulling the list of members that belong to that list and saving them into that csv file.

## Create a CSV file from a Sourcecon Twitter list

I see that Sourcecon has 5 lists.

![Twitter Sourcing with Tom Ordonez]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/twitter-sourcing-tomordonez-sourcecon-lists.jpg)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The first list is called "SourceCon 2017 Speakers". It has 26 members.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

![Twitter Sourcing with Tom Ordonez]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/twitter-sourcing-tomordonez-sourcecon-speakers.jpg)

This is the URL of this list:

<code>https://twitter.com/SourceCon/lists/sourcecon-2017-speakers</code>

What you need to get is the user name and the list name:

* User name: SourceCon
* List name: sourcecon-2017-speakers

Now let's create a CSV file with all the users that belong to that list.

<code>t list members -c SourceCon/sourcecon-2017-speakers > sourcecon-2017-speakers.csv</code>

![Twitter Sourcing with Tom Ordonez]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/twitter-sourcing-tomordonez-csv-file.jpg)

These are some of the columns from the CSV file:

* Date joined
* Date of last tweet
* Number of tweets, favorites, listed, following, followers
* User name
* Name
* Bio
* Location
* URL
