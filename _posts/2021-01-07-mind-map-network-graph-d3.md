A mind map network graph in D3 of topics I am interested in.

Blue lines are topics I've studied. Black lines are topics I want to study. Double click on a node to hold it in place. Double click to release it. You can also click and drag a node. Or freeze any number of nodes. When a node is frozen the color changes to red.
