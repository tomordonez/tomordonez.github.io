Follow this to execute a script in a different directory in Linux.


I had a script in `~/Documents/scripts/awesome-script.sh` and wanted to run it inside a different directory `~/Documents/images/awesome-images/`.

## The Subshell

You can use parentheses to create a subshell. Once the command is completed, the subshell will close, such as...

    $ (cd ~/Documents/images/awesome-images/ && ~/Documents/scripts/awesome-script.sh)

This is how it works:

* Use parentheses to create a subshell
* `cd` into `~/Documents/images/awesome-images/`
* If this command is successful then
* Execute the script located in `~/Documents/scripts/awesome-script.sh`
* When this command is executed. Close the subshell
