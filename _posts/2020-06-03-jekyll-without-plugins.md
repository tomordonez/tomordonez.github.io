Use Jekyll without plugins instead of using restricted custom plugins since these custom plugins might not work on Github Pages.

Here is a list of features to use [Jekyll without plugins](https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugins/).

### Reading Time

Similar to Medium you can show the time it will take to read the blog post.

Setup: [Jekyll Reading Time for Blog Posts](../jekyll-reading-time-blog-posts/)

### Search Box

You can also install a search bar.

Setup: [Install a Jekyll Search Bar](../jekyll-search-bar/)

## Text Expand/Collapse or Collapbsible Markdown

I often add whole output to every command I use. This can take a large space in a blog post and might disrupt reading focus.
