![Terminate SSH Connection]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/terminate-ssh-connection.jpg)

I keep forgetting how to terminate an SSH connection when it gets stuck.

I always end up in <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35524/what-can-i-do-when-my-ssh-session-is-stuck" target="_blank">this</a> page.

Type `Enter`, `~` and then `.` period.

This also works if you `vim` or `nano` a file and you come back to the shell and seems to be stuck. Typing this combination will exit.
