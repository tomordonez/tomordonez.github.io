This is an R tutorial with Rstudio and the data analysis from an ozone dataset.

## R tutorial with Rstudio

**Rstudio** is an open source software for `R`, a programming language for statistical computing.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website has data sets about ozone levels.

I downloaded 2 data sets from their website:

* Hourly ozone levels in the US from 2016. The zip file was 69MB. Uncompressed, the csv file is 2.1GB.
* Daily AQI by county from 2016. The zip file was 1.6MB and the csv file was 26.4MB.

`AQI` stands for `Air Quality Index`. A measure developed by EPA to explain pollution levels to the general public.



## Data Visualization

This is the data visualization that we are getting from this **R tutorial using Rstudio**.

## A bit more context about Ozone

To do exploratory data analysis from a data set you need to have a general understanding what the data is about.

* Ozone is a pale blue gas with a bad smell.
* Ozone odour is sharp, smells like chlorine and is measured in parts per billion (ppb).
* Concentrations of 100ppb and above damages respiratory tissues.
* Ozone layer is a portion of the stratosphere. About 20 miles above the ground. At about 100,000 feet.
* The ozone layer prevents UV light from reaching the surface. Which is actually good. But ozone at surface level. Not good.
* Bad ozone is due to fossil fuel burning.

## Loading the dataset into Rstudio

1. File > New Project
2. New Directory
3. Empty Project
4. Enter name and browse to subdirectory

## Install `readr`

If you don't have the package `readr` you need to install it. It will take about 5 minutes:

    > install.packages("readr")

The library `readr` is needed to read `rectangular data` such as `csv`.

Then load the library:

    > library(readr)

## Load the dataset `CSV` file with `read_csv`

Load the `CSV` file in Rstudio and create an object. The function `read_csv` converts the `csv` file into a data frame. If you don't specify the types for columns, strange things happen.

For example the data set has a column called `Time.Local`, which by default is of type integer. If you run a plot using `Time.Local` you will get the time in seconds instead of hours, such as:

    3600, representing 1am
    7200, representing 2am
    and so on...

The column type has to be set to `c` character so that `Time.Local` can take values like this:

    00:00
    01:00
    02:00
    and so on...

Setting the column types depend on the columns.

But how do you set them up if you haven't loaded the data?

The data source should have a description of the data. In this case there is more information about this data set on the <a href="http://aqsdr1.epa.gov/aqsweb/aqstmp/airdata/FileFormats.html#_hourly_data_files" target="_blank">EPA website</a>.

Here is the line to load the `CSV` into the object `ozone`.

    > ozone <- read_csv("ozone_data_2016.csv", 
    col_types = "ccccinnccccccncnnccccccc")

## Get the names of the columns

If you call this function: `names(ozone)` you get this result:

    > names(ozone)
     [1] "State Code"      "County Code"         "Site Num"           
     [4] "Parameter Code"  "POC"                 "Latitude"           
     [7] "Longitude"       "Datum"               "Parameter Name"     
    [10] "Date Local"      "Time Local"          "Date GMT"           
    [13] "Time GMT"        "Sample Measurement"  "Units of Measure"   
    [16] "MDL"             "Uncertainty"         "Qualifier"          
    [19] "Method Type"     "Method Code"         "Method Name"        
    [22] "State Name"      "County Name"         "Date of Last Change"

By definition `names` is used to get or set the name of an object.

If the object is a dataframe it gets the names of the columns.

## Normalize the column names

If you call this function: `make.names(names(ozone))` you get this result:

    > make.names(names(ozone))
     [1] "State.Code"      "County.Code"         "Site.Num"           
     [4] "Parameter.Code"  "POC"                 "Latitude"           
     [7] "Longitude"       "Datum"               "Parameter.Name"     
    [10] "Date.Local"      "Time.Local"          "Date.GMT"           
    [13] "Time.GMT"        "Sample.Measurement"  "Units.of.Measure"   
    [16] "MDL"             "Uncertainty"         "Qualifier"          
    [19] "Method.Type"     "Method.Code"         "Method.Name"        
    [22] "State.Name"      "County.Name"         "Date.of.Last.Change"

By definition `make.names` is used to make valid names out of character vectors. The `help` page explains that syntactically valid names consist of letters, numbers and dot or underline and start with a letter or the dot but not followed by a number. For instance `.2file` is not a valid name.

To normalize the column names, and replace spaces with periods, use: `make.names(names(ozone))`.

## Replace the names of columns

Finally, this is used to set this conversion back to the `names` object:

    > names(ozone) <- make.names(names(ozone))

Now, when you call `names(ozone)` the spaces are replaced by dots.

    > names(ozone)
     [1] "State.Code"      "County.Code"         "Site.Num"           
     [4] "Parameter.Code"  "POC"                 "Latitude"           
     [7] "Longitude"       "Datum"               "Parameter.Name"     
    [10] "Date.Local"      "Time.Local"          "Date.GMT"           
    [13] "Time.GMT"        "Sample.Measurement"  "Units.of.Measure"   
    [16] "MDL"             "Uncertainty"         "Qualifier"          
    [19] "Method.Type"     "Method.Code"         "Method.Name"        
    [22] "State.Name"      "County.Name"         "Date.of.Last.Change"

## Explore the data in Rstudio

Check the number of rows:

    > nrow(ozone)
    [1] 9124268

Check the number of columns:

    > ncol(ozone)
    [1] 24

Check the top of the file:

    > head(ozone[, c(6:7, 10)])
    
    # A tibble: 6 x 3
    Latitude Longitude Date.Local
          <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     
    1     30.5     -87.9 2016-03-01
    2     30.5     -87.9 2016-03-01
    3     30.5     -87.9 2016-03-01
    4     30.5     -87.9 2016-03-01
    5     30.5     -87.9 2016-03-01
    6     30.5     -87.9 2016-03-01

Check the bottom of the file:

    > tail(ozone[, c(6:7, 10)])

    # A tibble: 6 x 3
    Latitude Longitude Date.Local
        <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     
    1     18.2     -65.9 2016-12-31
    2     18.2     -65.9 2016-12-31
    3     18.2     -65.9 2016-12-31
    4     18.2     -65.9 2016-12-31
    5     18.2     -65.9 2016-12-31
    6     18.2     -65.9 2016-12-31

## Check the number of records for each hour

Using the `table` function in Rstudio.

This function "uses the cross classifying factors to build a contingency table of counts at each combination of factor levels".

In this case I know that the ozone levels are measured every hour from midnight to noon to 11pm. I would like to know the number of records for each hour.

    table(ozone$Time.Local)

This results in:

    00:00  01:00  02:00  03:00  04:00  05:00  06:00  07:00  08:00  
    369489 373144 359722 358576 363421 385829 386222 384176 381303 
    09:00  10:00  11:00  12:00  13:00  14:00  15:00  16:00
    379689 379424 380814 381202 383439 385152 386580 387565
    17:00  18:00  19:00  20:00  21:00  22:00  23:00 
    388252 388576 388656 388650 387492 377278 379617

## What does this data mean?

I selected and filtered parts of the data to understand more about it.

Was the data grouped by state? Or was the data grouped by hour?

## Install `dplyr` for data frames in Rstudio

The next step requires to use the library `dplyr`. Which is the next iteration of `plyr`, a set of tools for splitting, applying and combining data. `dplyr` "provides a flexible grammar of data manipulation...focused on tools for working with data frames".

    > install.packages("dplyr")

This might ask to restart the `R` session before installing. Then try again. Now load the library.

    > library(dplyr)

## US States in the data set

I wanted to see which states were included in the data set I loaded.

    > select(ozone, State.Name) %>% unique

    # A tibble: 52 x 1
    State.Name          
       <chr>               
     1 Alabama             
     2 Alaska              
     3 Arizona             
     4 Arkansas            
     5 California          
     6 Colorado            
     7 Connecticut         
     8 Delaware            
     9 District Of Columbia
    10 Florida             
    # ... with 42 more rows

## Ozone levels in Florida

I filtered the data set to see the ozone levels in Florida on July 9, 2016 at 6am for all counties

    > filter(ozone, State.Name == "Florida", 
    Date.Local == "2016-07-09", 
    Time.Local == "06:00") %>% select(County.Name, 
        Sample.Measurement)

The result was:

    # A tibble: 58 x 2
       County.Name Sample.Measurement
             <chr>              <dbl>
     1     Alachua              0.002
     2       Baker              0.001
     3         Bay              0.017
     4     Brevard              0.014
     5     Brevard              0.016
     6     Broward              0.005
     7     Broward              0.004
     8     Broward              0.004
     9     Broward              0.008
    10     Collier              0.004
    # ... with 48 more rows

## Convert PPM (parts per million) to PPM (per billion)

The sample measurement has units of `ppm` (parts per million).

To convert to `ppb` (parts per billion) you just move the dot three times to the right.

For instance, the first row that says `0.002 ppm` converts to `2 ppb`.

I learned that the EPA has an `AQI` calculator to convert from ppb to AQI (air quality index).

In the AQI calculator you have a few choices as shown here:

![AQI air quality index calculator]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/aqi-calculator-ppb-to-aqi.png)

* Select a pollutant: O3 - Ozone (8hr avg) or (1hr avg)
* Units required: ppb
* Enter the concentration
* Calculate

The way to choose between 8hr and 1hr is:

`AQI` values of `301` or greater are calculated with 1-hr ozone concentrations.

## AQI Categories

The EPA has a great website to learn more about the <a href="https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi#good" target="_blank">
Air Quality Index (AQI)</a>.

The AQI is categorized like this:

* **0-50**. Good. Green
* **51-100**. Moderate. Yellow
* **101-150**. Unhealthy for sensitive groups. Orange
* **151-200**. Unhealthy. Red
* **201-300**. Very unhealthy. Purple
* **301-500**. Hazardous. Maroon.

This information was very helpful to understand the data

## Very Unhealthy Jefferson county, Alabama

I filtered the data to find ozone measurements above 0.100 ppm (aka 100ppb). Which calculates to an AQI of 187 (Unhealthy).

    > filter(ozone, Sample.Measurement > 0.1) 
    %>% select(State.Name, County.Name, Date.Local, 
        Time.Local, Sample.Measurement)

    # A tibble: 1,407 x 5
    State.Name   County.Name Date.Local Time.Local Sample.Measurement
    .    <chr>      <chr>     <date>     <time>         <dbl>
    1    Alabama   Jefferson   2016-02-23   12:00:00   0.346
    2    Alabama   Jefferson   2016-02-23   13:00:00   0.202
    3    Alabama   Russell     2016-04-18   14:00:00   0.101
    4    Alaska    Matanuska   2016-04-08   02:00:00   0.102
    5    Arizona   Gila        2016-11-26   17:00:00   0.145
    6    Arkansas  Crittenden  2016-06-10   13:00:00   0.107
    7    Arkansas  Crittenden  2016-06-10   14:00:00   0.113
    8    Arkansas  Crittenden  2016-06-10   15:00:00   0.104
    9  California  Alameda     2016-06-03   15:00:00   0.102
    10 California  Alameda     2016-07-26   15:00:00   0.102
    # ... with 1,575 more rows

This shows that on `February 23, 2016` at noon, there was a measurement of `346ppb` in Jefferson county, Alabama.

Converted to AQI results in `276` aka "Very Unhealthy" and very close to "Hazardous", which is described as "Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected."

After a quick Google search I found that Jefferson county is amongst the top most polluted counties in the US.

## Exploring the data visualization plots in Rstudio

I know the names of some state counties in Florida. For example, for Miami, I know that the county is called "Miami Dade" but I wasn't sure how they added this value into the data set. If they put "Dade" or "Miami" or what combination of Miami and Dade.

For each state I created vectors with the names of counties. I visualized the vectors into a table and then created a filter for the specific county.

Finally, I plotted `Time vs Sample Measurement`.

I created a vector with Florida counties:

    > florida.counties <- filter(ozone, 
        State.Name == "Florida") %>% 
        select(County.Name) %>% unique

Then created a view:

    > View(florida.counties)

![Florida Counties]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/florida-counties.png)

On the view I saw they had it as `Miami-Dade`.

    > ozone.miami.2016 <- filter(ozone, 
        County.Name == "Miami-Dade") %>% 
        select(Date.Local, Time.Local, 
            Sample.Measurement)

I filtered by county name and then plotted `Time.Local` vs `Sample.Measurement`.

    > plot(ozone.miami.2016$Time.Local, 
        ozone.miami.2016$Sample.Measurement)

The output was an error:

    Error in plot.window(...) : need finite 
    'xlim' values
    In addition: Warning messages:
    1: In xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log)
     : NAs introduced by coercion
    2: In min(x) : no non-missing arguments
     to min; returning Inf
    3: In max(x) : no non-missing arguments
     to max; returning -Inf

The error says that one of the coordinates is a vector with `NAs`.

I looked up the types for each variable:

    > class(ozone.miami.2016$Time.Local)
    [1] "character"
    > class(ozone.miami.2016$Sample.Measurement)
    [1] "numeric"

`Time.Local` is of type `character` and `Sample.Measurement` is of type `numeric`.

    > head(ozone$Time.Local)
    [1] "15:00" "16:00" "17:00" "18:00" "19:00" "20:00"

    > head(ozone$Sample.Measurement)
    [1] 0.041 0.041 0.042 0.041 0.038 0.038

**You cannot plot character vs numeric.**

To prove that `Time.Local` was a vector with `NAs` I used the function `strptime`.

The function `strptime` is used to convert between character representations and objects of classes "POSIXlt" and "POSIXct" representing calendar dates and times.

I read more about `POSIXt` and it seems to be a complicated topic as described <a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/ColeBeck/datestimes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

The `strptime` function is used like this:

    strptime(x, format, tz = "")
      
    x: An object to be converted: a character vector
    for strptime, an object which can be converted to
    "POSIXlt" for strftime.

    format: A character string. The default for
    the format methods is "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S".

    tz: A character string specifying the
    time zone to be used for the conversion

I ran the `strptime` function like this:

    > strptime(ozone.miami.2016$Time.Local, '%H:%M:%S')

The result was something like this:

    [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
    NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 
    NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 
    NA NA NA

As far as the error saying:

    In xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log)
     : NAs introduced by coercion

I assume that `plot` is trying to make `Time.Local` which is a character element into numeric data. And when it fails to do this, it is returning NAs.

## Normalizing data in Rstudio

There is a way to plot `Time.Local` as a factor.

    > plot(factor(ozone.miami.2016$Time.Local), 
    ozone.miami.2016$Sample.Measurement, 
    main = "Best Time to Run in Miami", 
    xlab = "Hour", ylab = "Ozone level in ppm")

I suffered a bit with lower case and upper case variables.

To get the list of `State.Name` I did:

    > unique(ozone$State.Name)
     [1] "Alabama"      "Alaska"     "Arizona"             
     [4] "Arkansas"     "California" "Colorado"            
     [7] "Connecticut"  "Delaware"   "District Of Columbia"
    [10] "Florida"      "Georgia"

To get the `County.Name` for `District of Columbia` I did this but didn't get any results:

    > filter(ozone, State.Name == "District of Columbia") %>% 
    select(County.Name) %>% unique
    # A tibble: 0 x 1
    # ... with 1 variables: County.Name <chr>

I realized that I didn't use the exact case. Instead of `Of`, I used `of`.

    > filter(ozone, State.Name == "District Of Columbia")
     %>% select(County.Name) %>% unique
    # A tibble: 1 x 1
               County.Name
                     <chr>
    1 District of Columbia

I figured that normalizing the data is a pain in the butt.

I followed the same process to plot Miami, Washington DC, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

## Creating Data Visualization in Rstudio

Get a list of States:

    unique(ozone$State.Name)

Find the County Name. This will give you a table of County names:

    florida.counties <- filter(ozone, State.Name == "Florida") 
    %>% select(County.Name) %>% unique

    View(florida.counties)

In this case I found the county for Miami Dade to be `Miami-Dade`.

Filter the data and create an object:

    ozone.miami.2016 <- filter(ozone, County.Name == "Miami-Dade")
     %>% select(Date.Local, Time.Local, Sample.Measurement)

Create a plot with this object and add titles:

    plot(factor(ozone.miami.2016$Time.Local), 
    ozone.miami.2016$Sample.Measurement, main = 
    "Best Time to Run in Miami", xlab = "Hour", 
    ylab = "Ozone level in ppm")

## Creating the plot for San Francisco

    ca.counties <- filter(ozone, State.Name == 
        "California") %>% select(County.Name) 
        %>% unique

    View(ca.counties)

    ozone.sf.2016 <- filter(ozone, County.Name == 
        "San Francisco") %>% select(Date.Local, 
            Time.Local, Sample.Measurement)

    plot(factor(ozone.sf.2016$Time.Local), 
    ozone.sf.2016$Sample.Measurement, main = 
    "Best Time to Run in San Francisco", 
    xlab = "Hour", ylab = "Ozone level in ppm")

![Best time to run in San Francisco]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ozone-sf-2016.jpg)

    > summary(ozone.sf.2016$Sample.Measurement)
       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    0.00000 0.01600 0.02300 0.02243 0.03100 0.07000

Ozone levels in San Francisco:

* The lowest ozone levels in San Francisco are between 5am and 7am.
* The highest ozone levels are between 12pm and 3pm.
