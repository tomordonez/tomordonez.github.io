If you use double curly braces in code blocks in markdown with Jekyll. They just won't show up.

Enclose the code block in `raw` and `endraw` tags. Like this:

&#123;% raw % &#125;

some code here

&#123;% endraw % &#125;

Writing the previous line and make it appear correctly in this blog post sent me to a 4-hour bottomless pit of googling. I think it's not possible to show the raw/endraw code in a code block using the raw/endraw tags. Basically I am trying to show:

	open raw tag
	some code here
	close raw tag

This is mostly used to show code that has double curly braces:

{% raw %}

	{ {site.baseurl} }/assets/images/

{% endraw %}

I have also seen some strange behavior when adding a JavaScript code block and using Safari on mobile in Reader view mode. The HTML content is not displayed correctly. I thought that maybe my Jekyll template was broken.
