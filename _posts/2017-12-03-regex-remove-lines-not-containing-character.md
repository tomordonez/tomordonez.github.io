Use this regex pattern to remove lines not containing a character.

I want to remove lines that don't contain a space.
    
    ^(?!.* .*).+$

Or remove lines that don't contain numbers.
    
    ^(?!.*[0-9].*).+$

Or remove lines that don't contain UPPER CASE.
    
    ^(?!.*[A-Z].*).+$

Or remove lines that don't contain letters
    
    ^(?!.*[A-Za-z].*).+$

Or remove lines that don't contain an email
    
    ^(?!.*@.*).+$
