I"¼<p>This is a very interesting tool to preview your site before it goes live.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/test-your-site-before-it-goes-live.jpg" alt="Test Your Site Before It Goes Live" /></p>

<p>I have been using this tool when migrating sites from one hosting to another.</p>

<p><a href="http://hosts.cx" target="_blank">hosts.cx</a></p>

<p>You need to enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New server IP address</li>
  <li>Website name.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will get a URL.</p>

<p>When you preview the site some things might not display correctly, such as images, since they are cached.</p>
