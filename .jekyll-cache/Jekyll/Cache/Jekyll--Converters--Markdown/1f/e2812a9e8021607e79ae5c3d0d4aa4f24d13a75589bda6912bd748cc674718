I"D<p>Fixing a usb stuck in read only in Linux</p>

<p>As seen <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/563764/usb-devices-showing-as-read-only" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have an external drive that I used for backing up some files. I plugged it in again and tried to copy some files but got an error saying that the drive was in “read-only”.</p>

<p>This is applicable to Linux.</p>

<p>The solution was doing this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ killall nautilus
</code></pre></div></div>
