<p>Learn touch typing with 8 fingers to get ultra focused. The left hand is placed on the letters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ASDF</code>. The right hand is placed on the letters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JKL;</code></p>

<p>In the beginning you have to memorize the keyboard. But you always place your hands on the home row, the middle of the keyboard on the keys mentioned above.</p>

<p>Every keyboard in the universe is built with 2 dents. F for the left index and J for the right index.</p>

<p>To improve your touch typing skills I recommend playing a game called Z-Type.</p>

<p>Which is like space invaders but instead of martians you get words.</p>

<p>You have to type the words as fast as you can.</p>

<p>In the beginning you have to memorize the keyboard, looking down. But eventually if you practice a lot. Say 1hr every day for a month. You will realize that you never have to look at the keyboard ever again.</p>
