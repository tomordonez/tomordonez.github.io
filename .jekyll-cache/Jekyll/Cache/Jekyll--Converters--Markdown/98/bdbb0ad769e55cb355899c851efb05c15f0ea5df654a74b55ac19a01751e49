I"ß<p>I have been on a data science quest on and off for about a year and a half.</p>

<p>About a month ago I decided to accelerate my progress and I signed up to Python for Everybody in Coursera.</p>

<p>I implemented some Python scripts in the past and this website uses Python. But I wanted to get some detailed foundations before moving on to using Python for data science.</p>

<p>The first course in the Python for Everybody path is called ‚ÄúProgramming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)‚Äù.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the typical intro to programming.</p>

<p>They teach you basic syntax, types, conditionals and iterations.</p>

<p>They also teach you handling exceptions, which often is a more advanced topic but I am glad this was taught early on.</p>

<h2 id="programming-for-everybody-in-python-curriculum">Programming for Everybody in Python Curriculum</h2>

<p>Here is the curriculum for programming for everybody in Python:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Week 1: Why we program</li>
  <li>Week 2: Installing and using Python</li>
  <li>Week 3: Why we program (continued)</li>
  <li>Week 4: Variables and expressions</li>
  <li>Week 5: Conditional code</li>
  <li>Week 6: Functions</li>
  <li>Week 7: Loops and iteration</li>
</ul>

<p>I completed this course in about a week. Spent around 3-4 hours per day for 7 days.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with C programming you can do this course in less than a week too.</p>

<p>If you know what this is, you will find this course very easy:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for (i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you don‚Äôt have previous knowledge of programming I suggest that you take each week and spend time to get the knowledge to sink in correctly in your brain :)</p>

<h2 id="programming-for-everybody-in-python-example">Programming for Everybody in Python Example</h2>

<p>Here is a Python example related to programming for everybody.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs write a silly program that asks for the prices of items and calculate the total, the lowest and highest price.</p>

<p>Also print an error when you don‚Äôt enter a number and finish when you enter the word ‚Äúbatman‚Äù.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>lowest = None
highest = None
count = 0
total = 0

while True:
    price = input('Enter price: ')
if price == 'batman'
    break
try:
    price = float(price)

 except:
    print('Master Bruce please enter a number!')
    continue
    
total = total + price
count = count + 1

if highest is None or price &gt; highest
    highest = price
if lowest is None or price &lt; lowest
    lowest = price

print('Total is:', total)
print('Number of items:', count)
print('Highest price:', highest)
print('Lowest price:', lowest)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program shows:</p>

<p>The example uses all the lessons from the course with the exception of the for loop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>while</li>
  <li>try and except</li>
  <li>if conditional</li>
  <li>input</li>
</ul>
