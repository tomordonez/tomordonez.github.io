I"~<p>I recently moved from Wordpress to Pelican Python. Pelican is a static generator based on Python.</p>

<p>Through the years I have used many platforms.</p>

<p>I started in blogger. Then drupal. Then wordpress. Then tumblr. Then squarespace. Then Octopress with Github pages. Back to Wordpress. Then Medium. Back to Wordpress again.</p>

<p>I have been studying a lot of data science for the last few months and I am focused on Python now.</p>

<p>I initially thought of rebuilding my website from scratch using Python and Django, which could be a fun pet project. But I delayed learning Django.</p>

<p>Instead I decided on a static generator based on Python. I asked suggestions from my Linkedin network and a few people suggested Pelican.</p>

<p>This is Pelican on Github pages.</p>
